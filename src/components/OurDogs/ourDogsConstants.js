            If you are talking about an endurance dog, this is her.  Esther is athletic and agile,
             yet very delicate in her conformation; a true lady.  She never will be mistaken for a male.
             She is fast in the field, she can hunt like no other. She is intelligent and intuitive, ready
             to please.  She is sensitive to the moment which makes her the perfect srvice dog that she is.
             She is very active but quick to settle down when the situation requires which  is an essential
             quality every working dog should posses.  She has a lovely chocolate, silky wavy coat with highlights
             which has passed to all her offspring. She has consistently produce outstanding intelligent pups which
             make perfect service and therapy dogs.  She has gone as far as producing great hunting dogs! As one of
             our family dogs she is respected and appreciated for all the love she has given Laya without expecting nothing
             in return.  She has treated our children kindly always and taken a lot from their rough hands. She is a wonderful
             companion and very loyal. Esther has been and will be a true asset to the Australian labradoodle breed for all
             her traits that do pass to her next generations and her excellent pedigree that only Australian born labradoodles have.

          <p>She is the queen of the house. She owns underneath the dining room table and if you want to enter it, it’s by invitation only. She has a terrific personality. She is loyal and very, very smart. She is so elegant that she doesn’t walk, she struts like a dressage horse. Her coat is a super, super soft wavy fleece with gorgeous highlights. Everyone always make comments about what color she really is; she was born a chocolate but has not transform in a super gorgeous parchment. She is agile, playful and serious at the same time. She doesn’t give herself away, you have to win her; you have to be as smart as her to win her! Willow is definitely a show stop. Her elegance and queen like demeanor, surely turns heads everywhere she goes. Esther is her best friend and although she tries to avoid the 2 older boys she is in live with little joseph. He allows him to yank on her tail, pull her hair and lay on top of her.  Is as if she knows he is a baby and need to allow for his lack on understanding and to protect him.</p>

          <p>Ella is daddy’s little girl.  She has a very sweet demeanor, and sometimes you can’t even feel her in the house. She is very calm and loving. She has a super silky straight fleece coat with out of this world highlights. You can never get tired of running your fingers through her hair and I can spend hours enjoying myself brushing her coat. She is a rather small medium in size, which makes her sort of our “lapdog”. She loves to jump on daddy’s lap to watch movies and cuddle with whomever is available. We have high expectations for this astonishing beauty and hope with can have this supernatural coat pass to her next generations.</p>

We waited for this dark chocolate beauty for a very long time, sometimes we thought it was impossible to obtain her color but we were blessed and here she is, as beautiful as we hoped for. She’s smart beyond believe, sweet and loyal. As a puppy, she was absolutely cute and as a young adult, she’s stunning. We are in for a treat with this dark show-stop and hope she finishes out as lovable as her father and as intelligent as her mother and so far so good</p>
